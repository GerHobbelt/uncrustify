/**
 * @file reflow_text_box.cpp
 *
 * A big honkin' text reflow engine, used to reformat comments in 'enhanced' mode CMT_REFLOW_MODE_DO_FULL_REFLOW.
 *
 * This reflow engine works on a 'per-page' basis, where a 'page' here is one entire
 * comment. It does not work on a per-paragraph basis as that prevents the reflow
 * engine from making choices based on info spanning more than one paragraph in there,
 * such as when a bullet item spans multiple paragraphs and you like your text reflown
 * with spanning indent to properly identify the subsequent paragraphs as belonging
 * to the bullet item.
 *
 * Features:
 *
 * - recognizes (and applies) hanging indent
 * - widow and orphan control
 * - recognizes (nested) bullet lists
 * - recognizes (nested) numbered lists (numbering can be alphanumeric [configurable])
 * - allows enforced line breaks at end-of-sentence within a paragraph
 * - detects and keeps 'ASCII art' intact, allowing graphical documentation to survive
 * - recognizes boxed comments and can reflow these
 * - extremely flexible as almost all decision elements and parameters are fully
 *   configurable
 * - recognizes mixed 'leader' use and cleans up after you (e.g. when you're reflowing
 *   comments where only some lines are prefixed with a '*' comment lead character,
 *   a situation often happening when editing already formatted comments quickly in the
 *   heat of a deadline)
 * - supports a configurable set of 'directives', either as characters or tags, to hint
 *   the reflow engine (this is useful to keep a particular piece of formatted text
 *   exactly as-is, while the other parts are reflown)
 * - supports DoxyGen / JavaDoc / .NET documentation tags and adjusts formatting accordingly.
 *
 * This code resides in its own source file to help maintainance by keeping a very
 * specialized piece of output formatting functionality cordonned off.
